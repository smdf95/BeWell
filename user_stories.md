Put mood form on index, if the user says theyre happy, ask them if they'd like to make a journal entry or give gratitude within the community. If not happy, ask if they would like to reach a state of calm and bring them to the new calm page.

Get rid of mood, neg + pos emotions pages. Create one page called calm or something, and have it just assess negative emotions and symptoms(?) and give a list of exercises to do for that given symptom.

Maybe you can select multiple emotions, as well as multiple symptoms, and through python, we can filter the exercises to only those that are relevant to the symptoms and emotions selected.Then we can create a self-care plan maybe for the user.

I will get rid of the journal entry and turn the page into a list of resources for self-care. Maybe we can allow the user to add the exercises into a self-care plan.
